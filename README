# Kap Initial Scraper

Kap Initial Scraper (as the name implies) scrapes https://www.kap.org.tr/tr/bist-sirketler website which includes more than 500 Turkish Corporations.
KAP translates to "Public Disclosure Platform". It is a platform that every public company and every company that issues public debt (long term bonds etc.) must disclose their financial and non financial data periodically.
Sorry for the bad code and using mostly Turkish. This was literally my first Python project.
I will try to translate and clean-up code for general use.
